# Crowdsourced Project Management Toolkit
#### updated Feb. 2016 by DLF Project Managers Steering Group

**Note** This document is based off of a [crowdsourced Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aCZaScfh1VsvkOH4ksZDh6exzAH7n8_mMrpnw4yINcI/edit), created by the DLF Project Managers Group. All statements made are based off of testimonials and narratives written by contributors.

**What?** A crowdsourced collection of information, tips, techniques, and tools for project managers working in libraries. PLEASE CONTRIBUTE.

**Why?** Whether we realize it or not, librarians and library staff are managing projects all the time. These may be informal or formal projects, or we might not think of them as projects at all. Just the same, we could all stand to take a more organized and structured approach to planning and accomplishing our project work. Much of the project management literature and training frequently emphasizes a corporate perspective, which is not applicable to a library setting.

**Who?** Anyone who wants to contribute. And you can post anonymously if you prefer.

**How?** Be generous with your knowledge and be respectful of what others have written. Share your experience and help others to learn from both your successes and failures. 

See the [Digital Library Federation Project Managers Group page](http://www.diglib.org/groups/pmg/) for more information, including past meeting notes.

This section contains a list of tools for project management, with pros and cons for each. For more detailed testimonials and to see the document this was based on (and to edit it), see the [Crowdsourced Project Management Toolkit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aCZaScfh1VsvkOH4ksZDh6exzAH7n8_mMrpnw4yINcI/edit?usp=sharing) in Google Docs.

### 3. Trello

**Uses and Overview**

[Trello](https://trello.com) is an application for tracking tasks. It allows you to move individual cards (representing tasks) as they enter different phases. Trello allows you to assign tasks to different collaborators, create due dates, and provide contextual information for the tasks to be completed.

**Benefits:**

* very similar to analog/paper SCRUM boards
* feature-specific prioritization
* bug tracking
* useful for tracking action/discussion items from meetings
* able to link or attach supporting documents to cards

**Drawbacks**

* showing hierarchy of tasks not really possible
* not able to easily produce a to-do list (i.e. from the user's end, a list of tasks that the user is assigned to)

### 4. Google Apps

**Uses and Overview**

[Google Apps](http://drive.google.com) (specifically, Google Drive) is a suit of tools for creating documents collaboratively and sharing information. Google Apps include a text, spreadsheet, and slide editor, as well as applications for drawing, organizing calendars, and sharing (but not editing) other types of files.

**Benefits:**

* easy to share documents with large teams for collaboration
* easily searchable and organizable

**Drawbacks**

* you may need to use another tool to track/organize relevant documents, especially if there are a lot of them

### 5. Pivotal Tracker

**Uses and Overview**

[Pivotal Tracker](http://www.pivotaltracker.com) allows users to organize tasks by project and stories while integrating release dates and prioritization into the workflow.

**Benefits:**

* helps organize agile project teams that cannot meet in person

**Drawbacks**

* only free for thirty days (paid plans)

### 6. Jira Greenhopper (Agile PM)

**Uses and Overview**

[JIRA Greenhopper](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/agile) allows teams to "create and estimate stories, build a sprint backlog, visualize activity, measure team velocity, and report on progress."

**Drawbacks**

* paid service ($10 for teams of up to 10; $75 and more for 15 teams and up)

### 7. Redmine

**Uses and Overview**

[Redmine](http://www.redmine.org) allows you to track issues, latest project news, and organize projects by members and contributors. You can associate files with given projects, create Gantt charts and calendars, and create wikis to document projects. Redmine has a [demo site](http://demo.redmine.org) that allows you to see how it looks in action.

**Benefits:**

* open source
* plug-ins allow for extensibility
* ability to manage multiple simultaneous projects

**Drawbacks**

* doesn't work well with projects that aren't typical software development projects

### 8. Smartsheet

**Uses and Overview**

[Smartsheet](https://www.smartsheet.com) allows team to collaborate and communicate with a spreadsheet-style interface. It allows for file sharing, alerts and reminders, the creation of Gantt charts, and other features that will help to organize your projects.

* customizable and flexible
* links to other tools and services (like Google Docs)

**Drawbacks**

### 9. Slack

**Uses and Overview**

[Slack](https://slack.com) is a communication app for teams. It integrates with several of the project management tools on this list, and allows team members to communicate more easily and informally than through email.

* integrates with many other applications (e.g. Google Docs, Trello, GitHub, etc.)
* allows members to easily set up reminders, take notes-to-self

**Drawbacks**

* free version only has a 10,000 message capacity (older messages get deleted)

<h2 id="section2">Generic, software-independent recommendations for project management</h2>

* Wikis for project documents and documentation
* Google Docs or other collaborative editor for the creation of project charter, meeting notes, etc.
  * separate document (or folder) for meeting notes
* Ticket-trackers
* [Planning Poker](https://www.planningpoker.com)
* [After-Action Reviews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After-action_review)
* Scheduling using [Doodle](http://doodle.com) or Google Sheets is useful for tracking team members' schedules

<h2 id="section3">Project Charters - Defining your Project</h2>

The goal of a project charter is to document agreement between all parties (sponsor, stakeholder, staff) about the goals, scope, and deliverables of the project. Ideally, the document defines time, scope and cost.

It is useful to use this time to answer questions about cost/benefit and the extent to which people can actually reasonably contribute to the project. The Project Management Group recommends discussing the following questions at this stage:

* Why?
  * What are the objectives of the project?
  * What are the expected benefits of the project?
* Scope?
  * What is the scope of the project? (specifically, what's not in scope...)
  * How will we know the the project is done?
* Who are the stakeholders?
  * Who is the end user audience?Who?
  * Who is going to work on the project?
  * Who is managing the project?
  * Who is/are the sponsors of the project?
* How much time can participants reasonably spend on the project

After the answers to these questions have been decided upon, the Project Charter itself should be drafted. The following is the basic format of a Project Charter:
1. Project name
2. Description (high-level statement of your project goal)
3. Success criteria (how will we know when the project is done?)  – SMART goals
4. Requirements (deliverables, optionals, & out of scope) 
5. Project team (including roles) 
6. Milestones/Schedule (high-level + proposed dates) 

Drafting the charter is an iterative process:
* Write a draft
* Share it with project team
* Share it with stakeholders
* Rewrite
* Repeat until consensus

The [Project Charter Toolkit](http://project-charter-template.casual.pm/) can be a useful resource whether you are looking to understand what a project charter is or you’re just looking for some fresh ideas on laying out/structuring your particular charter. They have free templates to download, samples, etc.
